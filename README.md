## MDB Media Query Project

### Project Guidelines:

For this exercise, I’d like you to look at a simple API, TMDB API https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api, and write a web page that allows a user to search for movies by name. If results are found they need to be displayed in a nice and readable format, if no results are found then a friendly message should tell the user that their search didn’t find any results. You can feel free to expand on these requirements if you’d like, the goal here is to have fun and experiment with web services and web technologies. You are free to develop this however you want, use any technology, language, framework, etc. you’d like. It is highly recommended to deploy your working application to a runnable location, such as Github Pages.
